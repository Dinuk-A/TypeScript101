Typescript is a programming lang that adds TYPES to JS
arrow fns, classes were in TS before comes to JS
TS code are written in .ts files
TS transpiler converts TS code to JS code. if the TS code can be converted into a JS, it will output a .js file
TS is a superset of JS

TS recognizes JS's built in primitive types (lowercase, not like JAVA)
* string
* number
* boolean
* null
* undefined

when a TS variable is declared without an initial value, we can always give any type of new values if we need
let var1; 
var1 = 'hello'; // valid
var1 = 1; // valid

but if a variable is initialized with a value, its type is inferred from that value, and we cannot assign values of other types to that variable
let var2 = 'hello';
var2 = 1; // invalid

if we needed a variable to be a specific type but not assign a value at first, use type annotation
let mustBeAString: string;
let must_number: number;
let willBeBoolean: boolean;
